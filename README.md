# 🌤️ Weather App 🌤️

## 📖 Overview
The **Weather App** is a simple Python application that allows users to check current weather conditions for any location around the world. It pulls weather data from a reliable online weather API and displays information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description. This app is built using Python and the `requests` library to interact with the API.

## ✨ Features
- **🌡️ Current Weather:** View the current temperature, humidity, and wind speed for any location.
- **☁️ Weather Description:** Get a brief description of the current weather (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy).
- **🔍 Custom Location Search:** Search for weather data by city name or ZIP code.

## 💻 Technologies Used
- **🐍 Python 3.x**
- **🌐 requests:** To make HTTP requests to the weather API
- **🌦️ OpenWeatherMap API** (or any other weather API you choose)

🖱️ Usage
When you run the app, you will be prompted to enter the name of a city (e.g., "London" or "New York").
The app will fetch weather data for that city and display:
🌡️ Current temperature (in Celsius or Fahrenheit)
☁️ Weather description (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy)
💧 Humidity percentage
🌬️ Wind speed
